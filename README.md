# Uneven Pool

## Description
Uneven Pool is a 3D Third Person Control PC Game where the goal is to use one ball to knock another ball into a hole. It can be viewed as a combination of Pool and Golf. It is similar to Pool in that you use a ball to knock another ball into a hole; it's different from Pool because the game environment contains
obstacles such as blocks, ramps, etc. It is similar to Golf in that you knock a ball into a hole by knocking it over obstacles; it's different from Golf because there are moving obstacles and special objects like springs.
